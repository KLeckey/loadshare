\title{Quantiles for 3-depth}
\usage{
q3depth(p, N = 101, useAsymptotic = (N > 100))
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{the p-value for which the quantile is computed}

\item{N}{the length of residual vector considered in the normalized 3-depth.
This value is only relevant if \code{useAsymptotics=FALSE}}

\item{useAsymptotics}{a boolean variable. If \code{TRUE}, asymptotic
quantiles from the package \code{rexpar} are used (not published on CRAN,
only available via GitHub). Otherwise, simulated quantiles for the specified
N are used.}
}
\value{
the p-quantile of the normalized 3-depth
}
\description{
The (asymptotic) quantiles of the normalized 3-depth if the signs of the
residuals are i.i.d. unifomly in {-1,1} distributed random variables. By
default, asymptotic quantiles are used for residuals of length larger than 100.
Otherwise, simulated quantiles from an unpublished work by M. Horn
and C.H.MÃ¼ller (2019) are used.
